# Visualising predictions for the US recessions with the yield curves on the Tableau Public

## Project Summary

My new Tableau dashboard is now available for making predictions for the upcoming US recession which would take place in 2020 or 2021 at the lastest. 

The prediction is based on several inverted yield curves being observed during August 2019. When the yield curves, i.e. differences between the long-term US treasury bonds and the short-term ones, are inverted, chances of having a recession in the US is strong in the next 6 to 18 months. 

Since the US economy accounts for almost 1/4 global GDP (2016), other economies around the world are heavily affected by what's happened in the US to a great extent. Thus, predicting US recessions is very important for the US as well as other countries in responding to social, economic and even political uncertainties caused by the recessions.
